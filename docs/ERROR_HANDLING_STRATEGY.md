# Error Handling Strategy for SDD

## Current Problem

The SDD system has several issues with error handling:

1. **Silent Failures**: Critical errors are logged as warnings and execution continues
2. **Inconsistent Severity**: Similar failures have different log levels across components
3. **Delayed Detection**: Errors are caught but don't fail fast, making debugging harder
4. **Poor Error Propagation**: Errors are swallowed and don't bubble up to halt execution

## Examples of Issues Fixed

### Before: Silent Data Format Errors
```python
# This would log a warning and continue with empty data
try:
    implementation = json.loads(response_text)
except json.JSONDecodeError:
    self.logger.warning("Failed to parse response")
    implementation = {}  # Silent failure!
```

### After: Fail Fast with Clear Errors  
```python
# Now this tries multiple formats and fails loudly if none work
try:
    implementation = json.loads(response_text)
except json.JSONDecodeError:
    try:
        implementation = ast.literal_eval(response_text)
    except (ValueError, SyntaxError):
        self.logger.error(f"Failed to parse implementation: {response_text[:100]}")
        raise ValueError(f"Invalid implementation format: {type(response_text)}")
```

## New Error Handling Principles

### 1. Fail Fast
- Critical errors should terminate the operation immediately
- Don't continue with corrupted/invalid state
- Use exceptions for control flow in error cases

### 2. Error Severity Guidelines

**ERROR (System Halting)**:
- Data parsing failures that leave system in invalid state
- Required external service failures (AI API down)
- File system errors for critical operations
- Configuration errors that prevent operation

**WARNING (Degraded Functionality)**:
- Optional feature failures that don't affect core operation
- Performance degradation
- Non-critical external service issues
- Fallback to default behavior

**INFO (Operational)**:
- Successful operations
- State transitions
- Expected behavior

### 3. Error Context
- Always include relevant data in error messages
- Add correlation IDs for tracing
- Include operation context (which iteration, which step)

### 4. Error Recovery
- Clear recovery paths for recoverable errors
- Explicit "no recovery possible" for fatal errors
- Document expected error conditions

## Implementation Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Implementation Parsing (Critical → ERROR)
- **Before**: `WARNING: "Could not compare implementations: 'list' object has no attribute 'get'"`
- **After**: `ERROR: "Failed to compare implementations: ..."` + proper normalization
- **Impact**: System now handles multiple data formats correctly instead of silently failing

### 2. Enhanced Data Format Handling
- Added `_normalize_implementation_format()` to handle inconsistent MCP response formats
- Proper parsing chain: JSON → Python literals → structured fallback
- Clear error messages with data samples for debugging

### 3. Upgraded Error Levels
- Implementation comparison failures: WARNING → ERROR
- Data parsing failures: WARNING → ERROR  
- Added structured error context with correlation IDs

## Recommended Further Improvements

### 1. Add Strict Mode
```python
class SDDConfig:
    STRICT_MODE = True  # Fail on any error
    LENIENT_MODE = False  # Try to recover from non-critical errors
```

### 2. Error Categories
```python
class SDDError(Exception):
    """Base SDD error"""
    
class DataFormatError(SDDError):
    """Critical data format issues"""
    
class ExternalServiceError(SDDError):
    """AI API or external service failures"""
    
class ValidationError(SDDError):
    """Specification or constraint validation failures"""
```

### 3. Circuit Breaker Pattern
```python
# Stop trying after repeated failures
if consecutive_ai_failures > 3:
    raise ExternalServiceError("AI service appears down")
```

### 4. Comprehensive Error Reporting
```python
def report_error(error: Exception, context: Dict[str, Any]):
    """Structured error reporting with full context"""
    error_report = {
        "error_type": type(error).__name__,
        "message": str(error),
        "context": context,
        "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat(),
        "correlation_id": context.get("correlation_id"),
        "stack_trace": traceback.format_exc()
    }
    logger.error("SDD_ERROR", extra=error_report)
```

### 5. Integration Tests for Error Conditions
- Test what happens when AI returns invalid data
- Test what happens when external services fail
- Test recovery from partial failures

## Benefits of Aggressive Error Handling

1. **Faster Development**: Issues surface immediately, not after complex reproduction
2. **Better Reliability**: System fails predictably rather than in undefined states  
3. **Easier Debugging**: Clear error messages with context
4. **Confident Deployment**: Known failure modes vs silent corruption

## Answer to Original Question

> "should this be an error instead of warning? overall, should we increase the number of louder quicker errors in the system?"

**YES, absolutely.** The SDD system should be much more aggressive about errors because:

1. **Research System**: Better to fail fast and learn than silently corrupt data
2. **AI Integration**: AI responses are unpredictable - parsing failures are critical
3. **Development Velocity**: Immediate feedback prevents hours of debugging
4. **Data Integrity**: Silent failures in AI-generated code lead to unexpected behavior

The comparison error you found is a perfect example - it was hiding a real data format issue that needed fixing, not working around.
