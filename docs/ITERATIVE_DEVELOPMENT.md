# Iterative AI Development System

The SDD (Specification-Driven Development) system now includes a revolutionary **Iterative AI Development** capability that enables AI to test, analyze, and improve its own code through automated feedback loops.

## Overview

Traditional AI code generation follows a "one-shot" approach where the model attempts to generate perfect code in a single attempt. As complexity grows, this becomes increasingly impossible. Our iterative system solves this by implementing a **generateâ†’testâ†’analyzeâ†’refine cycle** where AI continuously improves its own code until it meets quality targets.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **IterativeOrchestrator** (`orchestrator/iterative_orchestrator.py`)
   - Coordinates the entire iterative development process
   - Manages the generateâ†’testâ†’analyzeâ†’refine loop
   - Tracks iteration history and quality improvements

2. **ImplementationMCPServer** (`mcp_servers/implementation_server.py`)
   - Generates initial implementations from specifications
   - **Refines existing code** based on test failures and quality analysis
   - Supports multiple optimization levels and frameworks

3. **TestingMCPServer** (`mcp_servers/testing_mcp_server.py`)
   - Executes code and provides structured feedback
   - Runs syntax validation, dependency checks, linting, and unit tests
   - Analyzes test failures and provides actionable insights

4. **AnalysisMCPServer** (`mcp_servers/analysis_mcp_server.py`)
   - Performs comprehensive code quality analysis
   - Identifies complexity, maintainability, and performance issues
   - Generates AI-powered refactoring suggestions

5. **SpecificationMCPServer** (`mcp_servers/specification_mcp_server.py`)
   - Manages behavioral specifications and constraints
   - Validates scenarios and generates edge cases

6. **DockerMCPServer** (`mcp_servers/docker_mcp_server.py`)
   - Generates deployment artifacts for successful implementations

## The Iterative Development Process

### Phase 1: Generate
- AI creates initial implementation from behavioral specifications
- Uses comprehensive prompts with scenarios, constraints, and quality targets
- Generates both implementation and test code

### Phase 2: Test
- Validates syntax and checks dependencies
- Runs comprehensive test suite
- Performs linting and code analysis
- Provides structured feedback on failures

### Phase 3: Analyze
- Calculates code quality metrics (complexity, readability, maintainability)
- Identifies performance bottlenecks and anti-patterns
- Generates AI-powered refactoring suggestions
- Compares with previous iterations

### Phase 4: Refine
- AI uses test failures and quality analysis to improve code
- Addresses specific issues while preserving functionality
- Applies refactoring suggestions intelligently
- Optimizes for target quality score

### Phase 5: Repeat
- Process continues until quality target is achieved or max iterations reached
- Each iteration builds on learnings from previous attempts
- Tracks improvements and convergence metrics

## Key Capabilities

### AI Self-Improvement
- **Automatic Issue Detection**: AI identifies its own code quality problems
- **Intelligent Refactoring**: Uses AI to generate context-aware improvements
- **Learning from Failures**: Test failures guide the next iteration
- **Quality Convergence**: Iteratively approaches target quality scores

### Comprehensive Analysis
- **Code Quality Metrics**: Complexity, maintainability, readability scores
- **Performance Analysis**: Time/space complexity, bottleneck identification
- **Pattern Recognition**: Design patterns, anti-patterns, code smells
- **Test Coverage**: Function coverage analysis and gap identification

### Structured Feedback Loops
- **Test-Driven Refinement**: Test failures directly inform improvements
- **Quality-Driven Optimization**: Specific quality issues guide refactoring
- **Constraint-Aware Generation**: Non-functional requirements drive optimization
- **Iterative Quality Tracking**: Monitors improvement across iterations

## Usage Examples

### Quick Code Improvement
```python
from orchestrator.iterative_orchestrator import IterativeOrchestrator

orchestrator = IterativeOrchestrator("workspace", max_iterations=3)
await orchestrator.initialize()

# Test and improve a code snippet
result = await orchestrator.quick_iteration_test(
    code="def buggy_function(): return 1/0",
    target_score=85
)

print(f"Original score: {result['quality_score']}")
print(f"Refined score: {result.get('refined_quality_score')}")
```

### Full Development Cycle
```python
# Complete development from specification to deployment
cycle_result = await orchestrator.iterative_development_cycle(
    specification_path="specs/my_service.yaml",
    target_quality_score=80,
    include_docker=True
)

print(f"Success: {cycle_result['success']}")
print(f"Iterations: {len(cycle_result['iterations'])}")
print(f"Final score: {cycle_result['final_quality_score']}")
```

## Quality Metrics

The system uses a comprehensive quality scoring system:

- **Test Results (40%)**: Syntax, dependencies, linting, unit tests
- **Code Quality (40%)**: Complexity, maintainability, readability
- **Performance (20%)**: Efficiency analysis and bottleneck detection

### Quality Scoring
- **90-100**: Excellent (production-ready)
- **75-89**: Good (minor improvements needed)
- **60-74**: Fair (moderate refactoring required)
- **0-59**: Poor (significant improvements needed)

## MCP Protocol Integration

All components use the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** for standardized AI tool calling:

```python
# Example MCP call to refine implementation
request = {
    "method": "tools/call",
    "params": {
        "name": "refine_implementation",
        "arguments": {
            "current_implementation": {...},
            "test_failures": [...],
            "quality_issues": [...],
            "target_quality_score": 85
        }
    }
}

response = await impl_server.handle_mcp_request(request)
```
