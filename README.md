## What is this?

A revolutionary approach to building software where:
- **You describe** what you want the system to do (in plain English)
- **AI builds** the entire implementation
- **The system verifies** everything works correctly
- **AI maintains** and optimizes the code over time

## Why does this matter?

Traditional software development requires writing detailed code. With SDD:
- âœ… Focus on business requirements, not technical implementation
- âœ… Automatic optimization for performance and security
- âœ… Self-healing systems that detect and fix problems
- âœ… No more debugging code at 3am - debug behaviors instead

## Quick Example

Instead of writing code, you write:
```yaml
scenario: Process payment
  given: Customer has items in cart totaling $100
  when: Customer submits valid credit card
  then: 
    - Payment is processed within 5 seconds
    - Order confirmation is sent
    - Inventory is updated
```

The system automatically:

- Generates all the code
- Creates comprehensive tests
- Optimizes for performance
- Monitors for degradation
- Fixes issues proactively

## How to Get Started

Define your scenarios - What should your system do?
Set constraints - How fast? How secure? How scalable?
Review and approve - AI suggests edge cases you might have missed
Deploy - The system generates, tests, and deploys everything

## Key Concepts

Scenarios
Describe user interactions and expected outcomes using Given/When/Then format.

Constraints
Define non-functional requirements like performance, security, and reliability.

MCP Servers
Specialized AI agents that handle different aspects of the system.

Behavior-Centric Operations
Monitor and debug what the system does, not how it does it.

## Project Status
This is an active research project exploring the future of software development. We're building:

- ðŸš§ Core MCP servers for specification and implementation
- ðŸš§ Orchestration layer for end-to-end workflows
- ðŸš§ Production monitoring and auto-remediation
- ðŸš§ Real-world examples and case studies

## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+** (tested on 3.11-slim via Docker)
- **pip**
- **docker & docker-compose** (optional, for containerized development)

### Local Setup

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Using Docker

Alternatively, you can work inside a Docker container without installing dependencies locally:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose exec python bash
# inside the container:
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run commands directly without entering the shell:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm python pytest
```

## Running Tests

This project uses pytest for unit and integration testing.

To run the spec-to-code pipeline integration test:

```bash
pytest tests/integration/test_spec_to_code_pipeline.py
```

To execute the full test suite:

```bash
pytest
```
