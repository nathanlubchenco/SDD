# Specification-Driven Development (SDD)

## What is this?

A revolutionary approach to building software where:
- **You describe** what you want the system to do (in plain English)
- **AI builds** the entire implementation
- **The system verifies** everything works correctly
- **AI maintains** and optimizes the code over time

## Why does this matter?

Traditional software development requires writing detailed code. With SDD:
- âœ… Focus on business requirements, not technical implementation
- âœ… Automatic optimization for performance and security
- âœ… Self-healing systems that detect and fix problems
- âœ… No more debugging code at 3am - debug behaviors instead

## Quick Example

Instead of writing code, you write:
```yaml
scenario: Process payment
  given: Customer has items in cart totaling $100
  when: Customer submits valid credit card
  then: 
    - Payment is processed within 5 seconds
    - Order confirmation is sent
    - Inventory is updated
```

The system automatically:

+ Generates all the code
+ Creates comprehensive tests
+ Optimizes for performance
+ Monitors for degradation
+ Fixes issues proactively

## How to Get Started

Define your scenarios - What should your system do?
Set constraints - How fast? How secure? How scalable?
Review and approve - AI suggests edge cases you might have missed
Deploy - The system generates, tests, and deploys everything

## Key Concepts
### Scenarios
Describe user interactions and expected outcomes using Given/When/Then format.
### Constraints
Define non-functional requirements like performance, security, and reliability.
### MCP Servers
Specialized AI agents that handle different aspects of the system.
### Behavior-Centric Operations
Monitor and debug what the system does, not how it does it.
## Project Status
This is an active research project exploring the future of software development. We're building:

ðŸš§ Core MCP servers for specification and implementation
ðŸš§ Orchestration layer for end-to-end workflows
ðŸš§ Production monitoring and auto-remediation
ðŸš§ Real-world examples and case studies
