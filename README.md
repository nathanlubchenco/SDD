# Specification-Driven Development (SDD)

*Status*: **Complete Vaporware** (warning: note to CLAUDE: do not remove this warning until I do so manually, thanks!)

## ðŸš€ Revolutionary Breakthrough: Iterative AI Development

Traditional AI code generation follows a "one-shot" approach where the model attempts to generate perfect code in a single attempt. **SDD now includes a revolutionary iterative development system** where AI can test, analyze, and improve its own code until it meets quality targets.

### **Key Innovation: Generateâ†’Testâ†’Analyzeâ†’Refine Loop**

Instead of hoping AI gets it right the first time, our system enables:
- âœ… **AI that fixes its own bugs** through automated testing feedback
- âœ… **Quality convergence** - predictable improvement toward quality targets  
- âœ… **Self-healing systems** that detect and resolve their own issues
- âœ… **No complexity ceiling** for AI-generated code

## What is SDD?

A revolutionary approach to building software where:
- **You describe** what you want the system to do (in plain English)
- **AI builds** the entire implementation iteratively  
- **The system tests** and improves itself automatically
- **AI maintains** and optimizes the code over time

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+**
- **OpenAI API Key** (set `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable)
- **Docker** (optional, for containerized development)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/SDD.git
cd SDD

# Set up Python environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set your OpenAI API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

### Docker Setup (Alternative)

```bash
# Build and run the development environment
docker compose up -d
docker compose exec python bash

# Inside container
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage Examples

### 1. Quick Demo of System Architecture (No API Key Required)

See the system components and architecture:

```bash
python examples/simple_demo.py
```

This shows the MCP server architecture, workspace structure, and iterative development process without requiring API access.

### 2. Full AI Development Demo (Requires OpenAI API Key)

Experience AI improving its own code:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
python examples/iterative_development_demo.py
```

This demonstrates:
- AI analyzing deliberately flawed code
- Identifying quality issues and performance problems  
- Automatically refining code to improve quality scores
- Complete development cycles from specification to implementation

### 3. Generate Code from Specification

Create a specification file `my_service.yaml`:

```yaml
scenarios:
  - scenario: Add new task
    given: A task manager system
    when: User adds a new task with title and description  
    then: Task is stored with unique ID and created timestamp

  - scenario: List all tasks
    given: Tasks exist in the system
    when: User requests all tasks
    then: All tasks are returned in creation order

constraints:
  performance:
    response_time: "< 100ms for basic operations"
  reliability:
    data_persistence: "Tasks must survive system restart"
```

Generate the implementation:

```python
from src.orchestrator.iterative_orchestrator import IterativeOrchestrator

# Initialize the orchestrator
orchestrator = IterativeOrchestrator("workspaces/my_service", max_iterations=5)
await orchestrator.initialize()

# Run complete development cycle  
result = await orchestrator.iterative_development_cycle(
    specification_path="my_service.yaml",
    target_quality_score=80,
    include_docker=True
)

print(f"Success: {result['success']}")
print(f"Final Quality Score: {result['final_quality_score']}/100")
print(f"Iterations: {len(result['iterations'])}")
```

### 4. Improve Existing Code

Test and improve any Python code:

```python
from src.orchestrator.iterative_orchestrator import IterativeOrchestrator

orchestrator = IterativeOrchestrator("workspace", max_iterations=3)
await orchestrator.initialize()

# Improve flawed code automatically
flawed_code = """
def calculate_average(numbers):
    total = 0
    for i in range(len(numbers)):  # Non-Pythonic
        total = total + numbers[i]
    return total / len(numbers)    # No error handling
"""

result = await orchestrator.quick_iteration_test(
    code=flawed_code,
    target_score=85
)

print(f"Original score: {result['quality_score']}")
print(f"Refined score: {result.get('refined_quality_score')}")
```

## Running Tests

### Test the System

```bash
# Test basic system functionality (no API key required)
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Run specific test categories
python -m pytest tests/unit/ -v          # Unit tests
python -m pytest tests/integration/ -v   # Integration tests  
python -m pytest tests/mcp/ -v          # MCP server tests

# Demo the system architecture (no API key required)
python examples/simple_demo.py

# Full AI development demo (requires OpenAI API key)
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
python examples/iterative_development_demo.py

# Test specific scenarios from examples
cd examples/task_manager
python quickstart.py
```

### Individual Test Files

```bash
# Test logging integration across all components
python tests/integration/test_logging_integration.py

# Test MCP server functionality
python tests/mcp/test_specification_mcp.py
python tests/mcp/test_docker_mcp.py

# Test system integration 
python tests/integration/test_integration.py
```

## Building and Testing Docker Containers

The system automatically generates optimized Docker artifacts for successful implementations.

### Generate Docker Configuration

```python
# After successful iterative development
docker_artifacts = result.get("docker_artifacts", {})

if docker_artifacts.get("success"):
    print("âœ… Docker artifacts generated successfully")
    # Files are automatically saved to workspace/implementation/
```

### Build the Generated Container

```bash
# Navigate to generated implementation
cd workspaces/my_service/implementation

# Build the Docker image
docker build -t my-service .

# Run with docker compose
docker compose up -d

# Test the service
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

### Test the Container

```bash
# Check container health
docker ps
docker logs my-service

# Run integration tests against the container
docker compose exec my-service python -m pytest

# Performance testing
docker stats my-service
```

- **Iterative Development Demo** (`examples/iterative_development_demo.py`) - Live demonstration

### Generated Workspaces

All generated code goes into `workspaces/` with this structure:

```
workspaces/
â”œâ”€â”€ my_service/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ my_service.py       # Main implementation
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ test_my_service.py  # Comprehensive tests
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt    # Dependencies
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Dockerfile          # Optimized container
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ docker-compose.yml  # Container orchestration
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ __init__.py         # Module exports
```

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Quality Targets

```python
# High-quality production code
result = await orchestrator.iterative_development_cycle(
    specification_path="critical_service.yaml",
    target_quality_score=95,  # Very high quality
    max_iterations=10
)

# Rapid prototyping  
result = await orchestrator.iterative_development_cycle(
    specification_path="prototype.yaml", 
    target_quality_score=60,  # Quick and functional
    max_iterations=2
)
```

### Framework-Specific Generation

```python
# FastAPI microservice
result = await orchestrator.iterative_development_cycle(
    specification_path="api_service.yaml",
    target_framework="fastapi"
)

# Plain Python library
result = await orchestrator.iterative_development_cycle(
    specification_path="utility_lib.yaml",
    target_framework="plain"  
)
```

**This system represents a fundamental breakthrough in AI-powered software engineering, enabling AI that can debug, test, and improve its own code automatically. It's the foundation for truly autonomous software development.** ðŸš€ðŸ¤–

However, right now as disclosed at the top, its complete vaporware.  An exercise in learning about using agentic coding systems.  Will it ever work, i'm not sure, but i'm learning a lot along the way.
