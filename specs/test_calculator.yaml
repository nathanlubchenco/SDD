scenarios:
  - scenario: Add two numbers
    given: A calculator service
    when: User requests addition of 5 and 3
    then: 
      - Result is 8
      - Response time is under 100ms

  - scenario: Handle division by zero
    given: A calculator service
    when: User attempts to divide by zero
    then:
      - Error message is returned
      - Service remains stable

constraints:
  performance:
    response_time: "< 100ms for basic operations"
  
  reliability:
    error_handling: "Graceful handling of all invalid inputs"
    
  security:
    input_validation: "All inputs must be validated"
