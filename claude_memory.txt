### üîß **Key Commands**

```bash
# Run integration test (primary system verification)
pytest tests/integration/test_spec_to_code_pipeline.py -v

# Test generated code in workspace  
cd workspaces/[workspace_name] && python -m pytest test_task_manager.py -v

# Full orchestration test
python -c "
import asyncio
from orchestrator.sdd_orchestrator import SDDOrchestrator

print('Success:', result['status'])
"
```

### üí° **Key Insights from This Session**

1. **Caching Transforms Performance**: 99.9% improvement shows caching is essential for production use

2. **Constraint Integration is Game-Changing**: When constraints automatically translate to code patterns, generated systems become production-ready

3. **AST-Based Analysis Beats Regex**: Moving from regex to AST parsing made auto-fixing much more robust and comprehensive

4. **Multi-Entity Systems Work**: Library management system proved SDD can handle complex relationships and business rules

5. **Error Handling is Critical**: Retry logic, validation, and cleanup make the system resilient for production use

### üî¨ **Session Learnings & Insights**

#### **Technical Discoveries**
- **Caching Strategy**: SHA256 hash of spec content creates reliable cache keys
- **Temperature Optimization**: 0.1 temperature provides much more consistent results than 0.0
- **AST vs Regex**: AST parsing catches edge cases that regex misses
