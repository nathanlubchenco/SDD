# Task Management System Specification

feature: Task Management System
  description: A system for creating, updating, and tracking tasks

constraints:
  performance:
    - name: API response time
      requirement: p95 latency < 100ms for all read operations
      measurement: Under load of 1000 requests/second

    - name: Write operation latency
      requirement: p99 latency < 200ms for create/update operations
      measurement: Under load of 100 requests/second

    - name: Concurrent user support
      requirement: Support 10,000 concurrent users
      measurement: Without degradation beyond stated latencies

  scalability:
    - name: Data volume
      requirement: Maintain performance with 10 million tasks

    - name: Horizontal scaling
      requirement: System must scale linearly up to 10 nodes

  security:
    - name: Authentication required
      requirement: All endpoints require valid JWT token
      exception: Health check endpoint

    - name: SQL injection prevention
      requirement: All user inputs must be parameterized
      verification: OWASP ZAP scan shows no SQL injection vulnerabilities

    - name: Rate limiting
      requirement: Max 100 requests per minute per user

  reliability:
    - name: Uptime
      requirement: 99.9% availability

    - name: Data durability
      requirement: No data loss on single node failure

    - name: Graceful degradation
      requirement: Read operations continue during write failures

scenarios:
  - name: Create a simple task
    when: I create a task with title "Buy groceries"
    then:
      - A task should exist with title "Buy groceries"
      - The task should have status "pending"
      - The task should have a unique ID
      - The task should have a created_at timestamp

  - name: Complete a task
    given: A task exists with title "Buy groceries" and status "pending"
    when: I mark the task as complete
    then:
      - Task status is "completed"
      - The task should have a completed_at timestamp
      - The completed_at should be after created_at

  - name: Cannot complete already completed task
    given: A task exists with status "completed"
    when: I try to mark the task as complete again
    then:
      - I should receive an error "Task is already completed"
      - The task status should remain "completed"
      - The original completed_at should not change

  - name: List tasks filtered by status
    given:
      - A task "Task 1" with status "pending"
      - A task "Task 2" with status "completed"
      - A task "Task 3" with status "pending"
    when: I list tasks with status "pending"
    then:
      - I should see exactly 2 tasks
      - The tasks should be "Task 1" and "Task 3"
